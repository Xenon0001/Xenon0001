## 🏆 Achievements
- **Second Place in Hackathon by bosco (FP SALESCIANOS BATA):** Participated in bosco Hackathon, where the challenge was to create a program that could interconnect all hospitals in the country. This would allow any hospital to access a patient's medical records in case of an emergency, ensuring timely treatment. During this hackathon, I appreciated the importance of teamwork while enjoying the occasion and learning not only programming concepts but also networking.
